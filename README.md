# andrewmorris.io

This repo tracks the state of my website at https://andrewmorris.io. I called the repo 'flat-website' because it contains built versions of everything and doesn't specify how anything is generated as it should. In the future I hope to do this more intelligently and will call the project 'website'. I wanted to use a separate repository so that 'website' can be nice and lean, without the excess weight of versioning the result of builds.
